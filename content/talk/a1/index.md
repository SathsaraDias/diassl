**Oral Presentation:** NERCCS 2024 – Seventh Northeast Regional Conference on Complex Systems, Clarkson University, USA, Mar 2024

This talk focused on recent research progress in dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and its role in analyzing high-dimensional, time-series data from complex systems. Methodologies, case studies, and future directions were discussed. (Slides and further details will be made available soon.)
