**Poster Presentation:** SIAM DS23, Applications of Dynamical Systems, USA, May 2023

This poster presented recent advances in data-driven modeling and dynamic mode decomposition for the study of nonlinear dynamical systems. The session included practical applications and visualization of DMD results for complex, real-world datasets. (Poster and further materials will be shared upon request.)
