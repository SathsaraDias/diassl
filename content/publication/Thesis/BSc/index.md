abstract: >
  This study assessed the human risk associated with lightning and analyzed the long-term variation of lightning-related casualties in Sri Lanka. Given the lack of persistent nationwide data on lightning casualties, the research utilized a comprehensive review of newspaper articles archived in the Department of National Archives, covering incidents from 1958 to 2009. The study identified high-risk periods, regions, and the most common causes of casualties, with special attention to indoor and outdoor risk profiles. Findings revealed that the majority of casualties occurred outdoors, predominantly affecting those engaged in agricultural or outdoor activities, and that incidents were heavily concentrated within specific months of the year. The study highlighted the critical importance of lightning safety awareness, particularly for vulnerable populations, and recommended the implementation of improved data collection systems at the national and local levels to enhance disaster risk reduction programs.
